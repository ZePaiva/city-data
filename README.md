## Components

### [city-data-gather](./city-data-gathering "backend component")
Gathers data from multiple external API's and processes them in order to display it

#### Dependencies:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


#### Building:
To build the backend simply use `npm install` or build the docker container
```
$ docker build -t city-gather:latest ./city-data-gathering
```

#### Testing:
To test simply run `npm test`


#### Running:
You have the option to run the container by using either the compose or the docker CLI
```
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker run --name city-gather -d -p 8000:8000 city-gather
```
After executing one of the aforementioned commands check if the `docker ps` output is similar to this
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
5e2938573495        city-gather         "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   4 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds        0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   city-gather
```


Optionally you can run the application in your own machine with teh following command:
```
npm run start
```

Be advised that this was developed for a linux system with Node.js so there is no guarantee it will work in MS Windows systems as is.
