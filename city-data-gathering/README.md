# city-data-gathering
## Dependencies:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/) (optional for documentation)


## Building:
To build the backend simply use `npm install` or build the docker volume and container
```
$ docker build -t city-gather:latest ./city-data-gathering
$ docker volume create city-gather-volume
```

## Testing:
To test simply run `npm test`


## Running:
You have the option to run the container by using either the compose or the docker CLI
```
$ docker run --name city-gather -d -p 8000:8000 city-gather -v city-gather-volume:/app
```
After executing one of the aforementioned commands check if the `docker ps` output is similar to this
```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
5e2938573495        city-gather         "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   4 seconds ago       Up 4 seconds        0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   city-gather
```


Optionally you can run the application in your own machine with teh following command:
```
$ npm run start
```

Be advised that this was developed for a linux system with Node.js so there is no guarantee it will work in MS Windows systems as is.

## Logging and Debugging
The application automatically writes it's logging steps in logs/app.log.
To access this data in the docker volume execute the following
```
$ docker volume inspect city-gather-volume
[
    {
        ...
        "Mountpoint": <VOLUME-DIRECTORY>
        ...
    }
]
$ cd <VOLUME-DIRECTORY>/_data/logs
$ cat app.log
```

If your user does not have the proper docker permissions try using superuser permissions (`su -`) or check your user groups permissions 

## Code Documentation
Internal functions are documented.
Documents are provided in the `docs` directory but it is possible to generate them with the command `npm run docs`.

RESTful API is not documented as it only serves one endpoint (`/cdg/city_data`).
Argument for the API endpoint is a csv list of cities.

A request to the API would be similar to the following
```
$ curl -D GET \ 
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://<BACKEND_IP>:<BACKEND_PORT>/cdg/city_data?city_list=<CITY_LIST>"
```
Where `BACKEND_IP` is the deployment address, `BACKEND_PORT` is the deployment port and `CITY_LIST` is the csv list of cities to get info.

DISCLAIMER: If it is sent anything other then a csv list of cities then the request won't be processed.
